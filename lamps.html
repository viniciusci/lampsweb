    <h1>THE LAMPS NETWORK</h1>
    <p>Since 2014, the <strong>Latin American Metabolic Profiling Society</strong> seeks to strengthen its community in Latin America.</p><br>
    <p>Key research objectives of 21st Century science are maximizing energy and agricultural resources and understanding
      the relative contributions of genes, diet, lifestyle and other environmental factors that determine disease risk and 
      therapeutic responses of individuals and whole populations. Analytical methods such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
      and Mass Spectrometry (MS) among others, can be used to produce highly reproducible fingerprints of biological samples,
      characterize new material, foster discovery of new molecules, provide insight about interactions between macromolecules,
      study the ion flow in batteries, etc. Despite the potential of these analytical techniques to tackle the challenges of
      our century, dedicated facilities are limited in Latin America due to the high investment required, lack of equipment,
      low availability of trained scientists and low standardization of the technology among others. The Latin American Metabolic
      Profiling Society (LAMPS) is a young network that seeks to strengthen collaborations across the continent, promote emerging
      technologies and practices that help to make science more reproducible and open.</p><br><br>

    <h2>THE MEMBERSHIP</h2>
    <p>We like to keep things simple but formal. Find out more about the network and how to become a member by reading our charter
      below. When ready click here to postulate for membership.</p><br><br>
      <h2>THE CHARTER</h2><br>

        <p>The LATIN AMERICAN METABOLIC PROFILING SOCIETY - LAMPS will seek to find sustainable solutions to grow a robust and
           stable capacity for metabolic profiling in Latin America, that includes, but is not limited to: joint-institution
            training camps, continent-wide collaborative projects, sharing of experiences and practices relevant to Latin America
             and unified participation in international networking activities.</p>

        <h2>A MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT</h2><br>
      <div class="agreement-container">
      <a href="./assets/MoA Metabolomics Society_LAMPS_signed_20200218.pdf" download>

    <p>The LAMPS network aims addressing the challenges faced by the Latin American region, but nothing there is no point in working alone.
      Thus, in January 2021, an agreement was signed with the metabolomics society to look for solutions together. We hope that the LAMPS
      affiliation with the Metabolomics Society will aid in highlighting metabolomics research from the Latin America region and enable
      global collaborative and training opportunities.</p>
